# CSN09112 (Next Generation) - Network Security and Cryptography

Welcome to the Github repository for Edinburgh Napier University's CSN09112 Network Security and Cryptography module!
The module content contained in this repository is designed to be aligned with updates made to the base VM images found on vSOC in 2021.
Content for the previous implementation of this module can be found [here](https://github.com/billbuchanan/csn09112).

The main learning outcomes for this module are:

- Develop an advanced knowledge of key security/cryptography principles and methods.
- Understand the key academic principles and practical skills required to build security architectures.
- Design, implement, evaluate and critically analyse a system to a given set of security requirements.

Students enrolled on this module are assessed based upon sitting an open book test and handing in a coursework submission; each component is worth 50% of the total marks in the module.
