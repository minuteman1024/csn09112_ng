# CSN09112 (Next Generation) - Network Security and Cryptography

Welcome to the Github repository for Edinburgh Napier University's CSN09112 Network Security and Cryptography module!
The module content contained in this repository has been updated to align with updates made to the base VM images found on vSOC in 2021.
Content for the original implementation of this module can be found here.

The main learning outcomes for this module are:

- Develop an advanced knowledge of key security/cryptography principles and methods.
- Understand the key academic principles and practical skills required to build security architectures.
- Design, implement, evaluate and critically analyse a system to a given set of security requirements.

Students enrolled on this module are assessed based upon sitting an open book test and handing in a coursework submission; both components are worth 50% of the marks each in this module.
